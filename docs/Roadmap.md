# Project Roadmap: Advanced Expression Interpreter

## 1. Project Phases & Timeline (Fast-Track: 3 Weeks)

### Week 1: Foundation & Core Logic
- **Day 1-2**: Team synchronization, studying the Unified Grammar and Architecture.
- **Day 3-4**: Implementing the Lexer for all paradigms (C, Python, Prolog, Haskell).
- **Day 5-7**: Implementing the Parser and AST construction.

### Week 2: Evaluation & Refinement
- **Day 8-10**: Implementing the Evaluator/Interpreter logic.
- **Day 11-12**: Testing Arithmetic, Boolean, and Relational expressions.
- **Day 13-14**: Adding Error Handling and unifying output formats.

### Week 3: IDE Interfaces & Final Polish
- **Day 15-17**: Building the REPL/IDE Interface (CLI or GUI) for each language.
- **Day 18**: Cross-paradigm consistency check (ensure `1 + 2` gives same output in all).
- **Day 19**: Documentation compilation and code cleanup.
- **Day 20**: Final Submission.

## 2. Task Breakdown by Team Member

| Role | Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Member A (Imperative & OOP)** | Lead C and Python implementations. Coordinate Lexer/Server logic. |
| **Member B (Functional & Logic)** | Lead Haskell and Prolog implementations. Focus on pattern matching and recursion. |
| **Member C (Integration & Docs)** | Design the IDE/REPL, write documentation, rigorous testing, and ensure UI consistency. |

## 3. Immediate Next Steps
1. **Clone/Unpack** the provided scaffold.
2. **Assign Languages** to members.
3. **Start implementing Lexers** based on `Unified_Grammar.md`.
